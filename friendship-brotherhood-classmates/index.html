          Over the course of a human lifespan, 12 years represents a significant
          duration, not just for a friendship but also for a bond akin to
          brotherhood. The enduring connection between these two classmates
          follows this same pattern.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction to the brotherhood</h2>
        <p>
          Although I had known this individual since primary school, it wasn't
          until seventh grade that we finally crossed paths at an English
          extracurricular course. During this course, it became a source of
          humor that our teacher consistently mispronounced his name. In the
          meantime, my classmates teasingly dubbed me the "grade 6's gangster"
          because I had accidentally attended the wrong class. From that point
          on, whenever I wanted to tease him, I would affectionately use this
          nickname.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the conclusion of the English course, we didn't see each
          other for three years. However, at the beginning of tenth grade, by
          sheer coincidence, we both ended up attending the same high school and
          being placed in the same class. It was then that I approached him and
          inquired whether I had finally pronounced his name correctly. In
          response, he quipped, "You're the grade 6's gangster." That moment
          marked the inception of a beautiful friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot emphasize enough how high school became the most wonderful
          period of my life, and this person played a significant role in it. In
          tenth grade, he showcased his guitar skills to our class, revealing
          that he had been practicing for three years at that point. One of my
          favorite songs was "Forever" by Stratovarius, and although he knew how
          to play it, he never performed it. Consequently, in eleventh grade, I
          decided to learn to play the guitar myself. He recommended me to his
          guitar teacher. Initially, he believed I'd only last a few months, but
          to his surprise, I worked diligently and managed to play an entire
          song after a year. The guitar became an essential part of my life,
          bringing out my romantic side and providing me with a sense of calm. I
          owe him my gratitude for introducing me to such an excellent teacher
          with whom I studied for another five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, this friend had a deep passion for poetry and literature,
          despite being in a science-oriented class. This led to some amusing
          and peculiar situations. Due to the predominance of male students in
          our scientific class, he would occasionally playfully intimidate a few
          of us, myself included, by holding our hands and reciting Alexander
          Pushkin's "I love you" poem. At first, we were taken aback and tried
          to pull our hands away. However, we soon realized it was all in good
          fun, so we memorized the poem by heart. From then on, every time he
          held our hands, we would recite it along with him. What a comical
          twist that added to our friendship! To this day, it remains the only
          poem I can recall by heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we approached our final year of high school, with the pressure of
          graduation and university entrance exams weighing on us, we were among
          the few students who diligently completed homework assignments given
          by our school teacher. We still chuckle when we think about it, as we
          can't quite fathom why we chose to do our school teacher's homework
          while our peers turned to their extracurricular course instructors.
        </p>
        <h2>Darkest time</h2>
        <p>
          Certainly, conflicts were not absent from our relationship. Most of
          these conflicts arose during our university years. Unlike high school,
          where we spent each week in the same class with the same people,
          university life was different for us. We pursued different majors at
          separate universities, which naturally brought with it distinct
          perspectives and experiences. The physical distance also played a role
          in straining our relationship. I've come to believe that when
          conversations are scarce, it becomes challenging to maintain closeness
          with the people you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, one invaluable lesson I gleaned from that period is that
          when a friendship is genuinely pure and strong, it will invariably
          find a way to overcome conflicts and bridge the gaps created by
          distance. And that's precisely what happened in our case.
        </p>
        <h2>His marriage</h2>
        <p>
          That friend of mine had confided in me about his girlfriend a year
          ago. They had been friends for a year and a half prior to that. We had
          made several plans to introduce me to his girlfriend in person, but
          various obstacles, such as bad weather and illness, thwarted our
          attempts. Then, during this past Lunar New Year, he took me by
          surprise when he announced his intention to marry her, causing me a
          restless night of sleep. He was about to become her husband, and it
          was only after Lunar New Year's Eve that I finally had the opportunity
          to meet his fiancée at his home. It was during our conversations that
          I realized she was the very woman he was planning to marry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before their wedding, when they were preparing for a photobook shoot,
          I asked if I could step in as their secondary film photographer, and
          they graciously agreed. However, life threw me a curveball. Just a
          week before the shoot, I broke my camera and contracted COVID-19.
          Thankfully, she lent me her film camera, though hers had a viewfinder
          while mine was a rangefinder. I had only recovered from COVID-19 just
          two days before the shoot.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/3.webp" alt="My best bro and his wife" />
        <p>
          During the session, I was incredibly nervous because I wasn't
          accustomed to her camera. Yet, they placed their trust in me
          wholeheartedly. I relied on my knowledge of using a viewfinder to take
          the shots. In the end, their trust was well-placed. While half of the
          roll turned out unusable due to my initial blunders with shutter
          speed, the rest were true masterpieces. I initially set the shutter
          speed too low, resulting in blurry and overexposed photos. But I
          corrected my mistake by instinctively doubling the shutter speed, and
          it yielded perfect results.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/4.webp" alt="My best bro and his wife" />
        <p>
          On their wedding day, I had invested in a new camera equipped with an
          automatic light meter. The light meter proved to be a wise choice,
          saving me money on film and allowing me to focus entirely on capturing
          the moments without the need for meticulous light metering.
          Consequently, their film wedding photos turned out exceptional. Each
          of the 36 exposures resulted in a beautiful and lively picture. I had
          preserved their memories, capturing a purity and imperfection that
          made their moments truly special. They had hired professional
          photographers and videographers to document their perfect moments with
          telephoto lenses and gimbals, while I, with handheld recording and
          some shaky film photos, embraced imperfections on their behalf.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/5.webp" alt="My best bro and his wife" />
        <p>
          In the end, I hoped that my efforts helped them fulfill their desire
          for a memorable wedding. After all, we are close friends, and we
          aren't in pursuit of perfection. What matters most to us is purity,
          love, and the essence of our humanity within our brotherhood.
        </p>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          I eagerly anticipate the future they will build together, knowing that
          they will always have my support if they ever need it.
