          Many people find it easy to travel from one city to another city. For
          me, due to lots of stupid reasons (too cold, too far away, too rainy,
          etc.), I have had to wait my whole life to finally visit Da Lat city.
          From the people to the nature, it is difficult to describe how
          wonderful this city is in only a single word. Here, although I had got
          sick on the first day because of the temperature difference, I could
          eventually find the inner peace that I was always looking for for a
          long time.

          How is a small cold city able to retreat a person so well? Let’s
          explore!
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">People</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Delicate, simple, energetic. I believe that those words express
          everything about local Da Lat people’s vibes.
        </p>

          alt="Portrait of Mrs. Xuan Nam"
          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          The lady in the photo is Mrs. Xuan Nam who opens a small kitchen to
          serve food cooked by herself. She only takes reservation. Thus, I
          reserved my spot twice. Why did I do that? Because I always love
          talking with the local people who know best about their city and the
          daily life there. What makes her kitchen more special is that her
          husband, Mr. Duc, plays the piano beautifully. He plays, she cooks.
          How pleasing it is!
        </p>
        <img

          alt="He is playing piano"
          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I spent a whole hour only talking with him about music especially the
          history and the tips and tricks. He had studied engineering but he has
          a great passion for the piano. The piano helps him balance his life.
          Moreover, he loves Chopin. I remember seeing his eyes wide open when
          he talked about the difference between Chopin’s and Beethoven’s music.
          The conversation ended when his wife called me to have the meal she
          had prepared for me.
        </p>

          alt="She is cooking"
          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Before showing the meal, I would like to talk about Mrs. Nam’s cooking
          and serving method. After she confirmed my reservation, she would go
          to the local market to buy fresh beef, fresh fruits and fresh
          vegetable. Freshness makes the meal very organic and good for your
          health especially during a trip, you will eat outside most of the
          time.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          During the cooking time, she would ask me and other people to join the
          kitchen. Helping her prepare the meal was an unique experience. I
          believe that she was trying to create a better life for everyone.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          When I was having my meal, I had a chance to talk with other people
          around the table. The person I remember the most was a lady born in
          rural Hanoi but having been living in Da Lat for more than 10 years.
          She talked about her career, her life and her mindset. She asked me
          about my tourism business and recommended me to her friends working in
          tourism in Da Lat as well, which was very nice of her.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          After that, Mrs. Nam, the lady and I exchanged our phone numbers for
          future meet-up and recommendation. Then, we took some pictures, said
          goodbye to each other and I continued my journey in Da Lat.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Nature</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          The nature in Da Lat is quite complex. It could be peaceful, calm, or
          aggressive at the same time.
        </p>
        <img

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          This is Tuyen Lam Lake. It was serene on a rainy day. I parked my
          scooter near the lake. I walked around and used any protection I had
          to keep my camera dry and I started shooting. Because of the
          breathtaking sightseeing, I only wished that the film price had been
          low so that I could buy more film rolls to shoot more.
        </p>
        <img

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Turn around and drive forward, I visited Datanla Waterfall. The
          waterfall was so aggressive that the droplets could have damaged my
          camera any time if I stayed close to it. Thus, I walked back a bit far
          so there were no droplets being able to touch my camera. Then, I shot
          and the photo came into my life.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Cafés</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I visited 3 famous vintage cafés in Da Lat. I only took photos at 2 of
          them because I had to save my film for later.
        </p>
        <h3 class="post__heading_2">Duong</h3>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          My first impression when arriving at

          >
          was that I felt warm. It is a cozy café with a big bookshelf on the
          garret.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I ordered one season-based ice cream which was made depending on the
          current season. It was the season of plums so that they made me a plum
          ice cream. Sitting on the garret, enjoying my ice cream and did some
          research on how to extend my photography Instagram to more deep
          insightful content. It was this very café that made me decide to write
          blogs about photography and life on Medium.

          from the movie “Em va Trinh”. It is about the life story of a musician
          called “Vietnamese Bob Dylan” Trinh Cong Son. We, Vietnamese people,
          love his songs. Romantic, deep and sometimes sad.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          After watching the movie, I read more about the café’s history. I was
          fascinated that it was founded in around 1940. It has been the place
          for artists to gather there and let the atmosphere bring them to their
          highest creative state.
        </p>
        <img

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Entering the café and the atmosphere was probably suitable for the
          artist. I ordered one original yogurt. It is extremely difficult to
          find a handmade original yogurt. People in Da Lat call it “Yao gua”. I
          have no idea why they call it because in Hanoi, we call it a
          completely different name in Vietnamese.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuhuycto/personal-website/main/media/trip-to-dreamy-city/13.webp"
          alt="Tung Cafe"
          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          While I was tasting my “Yao gua”, they played some Andy Williams’
          songs. That good old songs – “Love story”, “Speak softly love”, etc..
          It was simple yet elegant.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Restaurants</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Beside Mrs. Nam’s kitchen, I ate at many other restaurants but I only
          took photos from one because of the same reason, film shortage!
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuhuycto/personal-website/main/media/trip-to-dreamy-city/14.webp"
          alt="Banh Canh"
          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I tried
          <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/r1pMSAtxm4mywZTt5?g_st=ic"
            class="post__link"
            >Banh Canh</a
          >
          which was noodles with fish sausage, fried onion and some fresh
          vegetable. It was not tasty and too spicy for me.
        </p>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          For the others, some give me too much protein (a lof of meat), some
          give me too much fat. Hence, no restaurants other than Mrs. Nam’s
          kitchen stay in my head.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Local Market</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          An interesting market. It is always crowded especially at night, which
          is the main reason of the traffic jam near the market. I buy nothing.
          I only walked around to see the market from my point of view.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuhuycto/personal-website/main/media/trip-to-dreamy-city/15.webp"

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          There is a famous spot called “Hong Kong spot” where the teenagers and
          the youth love selfies because the background looks like Hong Kong in
          the 1990s. I found a hard time to find a way to the spot. I had to try
          so many stairs, sometimes got stuck and had to go back. Finally, I
          made it and it was worth the try. I did not have any models so instead
          of taking photos straight ahead, I moved my camera down and captured
          the lively street below. It was so bustle.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuhuycto/personal-website/main/media/trip-to-dreamy-city/16.webp"

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Then, I “shot” the people around me using Joel Meyerowitz style. Some
          people only passed by, some people stopped and took a photo, some
          people stopped as well but talked to each other. What a mixture of
          people!
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Wrap-up</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          In conclusion, I had a big crush on Da Lat. Cold yet comfortable
          weather. Lovely people. Beautiful scenary. I assure that I will come
          back there one day. There are so many beautiful memories which is
          helpful for my well-being. See you again, Da Lat!
