          I did not take a food photo. This city is not famous for the food as
          described. What I had taken were the people and the sightseeing.

          I stayed at my aunt’s house. When I arrived, my nephew ran towards me
          and hugged me tight. Later, we found out that she mismatched me with
          my aunt’s son who looks mostly like me. That is why she hugged me so
          tight. We laughed a lot about that. I still love her as well.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Beside the mismatch, my nephew and I were close. She loved my analog
          camera, Canon Canonet G-III QL17. She was curious about why she could
          not see the photos after taken. I explained to her why the film camera
          was different but she hardly understood it. Generation gap came into
          real life clearly at that point. I took some photos of her using Fuji
          C200 roll to produce beautiful color in those. The film roll did not
          disappoint me at all. My nephew looked beautiful, playful and lovely
          in the frames.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          When I went outside, I ran into a park in which people workouted or
          played Chinese chess. I stopped, grabbed my camera and started
          shooting. It was the first time I used my new camera so that there was
          only one good photo from those shots. In this one, two men were having
          a tense match. One man saw me and waved his hand to fuck me off but I
          captured the right moment so that no angry gesture had shown in the
          photo.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Sightseeing</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          My aunt introduced me a local young man to be my “tour guide” on my
          first day in Vung Tau as well. He is 2 years younger than me. He is a
          good humble young man. After taking photos in the park, I went home
          and waited for the local man.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          When he arrived at my aunt’s house, we introduced ourselves. It was
          late afternoon so that he drove me to a coast where I could take some
          sunset photos. Unfortunately, there was no sunset at all. However, the
          scenary was so breathtaking that I could still catch some beautiful
          moments.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          This is an example from those beautiful shots. When I moved my camera
          down, I saw a lovely couple sitting near the wave-cut cliff and
          talking to each other. I “shot”, of course. What a combination of
          privacy and immensity!

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          We went down to the berm. Walking along, there was a scooter that
          someone had parked it and gone fishing. It looked lonely. Together
          with the cloud behind and the Fuji C200 film roll, the photo truly
          expresses its loneliness.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          In the next morning, I rode my aunt’s motorcycle back to the coast
          which my “tour guide” and I had visited to catch the sunrise. I was
          lucky this time. It was not cloudy. The sun rose higher and higher.
          The hard light could not stop me from shooting continuously.

          Street photography is great for that you do not need a model to have a
          good photo. You look around. If any person is perfectly in your frame,
          you click. I believe I learn that lesson by my heart.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Final words</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I could not say when I am going to visit Vung Tau once again.
          Nevertheless, I do know that it has a special place in my memory. I
          retreated myself well when staying in this city thanks to its
          atmosphere. Hence, One day, Vung Tau!
