          Throughout a human life, 12 years is a relatively big number for not
          only a friendship but also brotherhood. These two classmates’
          relationship duration is not an exception.

        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Introduction to the brotherhood</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Although I have already known that guy since primary school, it was
          not until grade 7 that we finally met at an English extra course.
          During the course, it was humorous that our teacher always
          mispronounced his name. Meanwhile, my classmates called me “grade 6’s
          gangster” because I attended the wrong class. Since then, I have been
          calling him by that name every time I want to tease him.
        </p>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          After the English course, we had not met each other for 3 years. At
          the beginning of grade 10, we coincidently attended the same high
          school and the same class. I then walked toward him and asked whether
          his mispronounced name was correct or not. He replied: “You are the
          grade 6’s gangster”. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
        </p>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I could not emphasize enough that high school was the most wonderful
          time in my life. That guy played an important part as well. In grade
          10, he showcased his guitar skills to the class. He told me that he
          had been studying for 3 years at that time. I loved the song “Forever”
          by Stratovarious. I asked him to play but he never played it in spite
          of knowing how to play that song. Therefore, in grade 11, I decided to
          learn how to play the guitar. He recommended me to his guitar teacher.
          At that point, he thought I only lasted a few months but it turned out
          that I had studied extremely hard to be able to play a complete song
          after a year. Without guitar, I believe my life would be different. It
          calms me down and brings the romanticism in me out to the world. I am
          thankful to him for introducing me to such a great teacher with whom I
          had studied for another 5 years.
        </p>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Moreover, that guy loves poetry and literature but he studied in a
          scientific-based class. Therefore, many weird funny things happened.
          Because of many male students in our scientific class, he would
          sometimes try to intimidate some of them especially me by holding our
          hand and reading the “I love you” poem by Alexander Pushkin to us. At
          first, we were shocked. We tried to push his hand away from us.
          However, we later understood that it was his joke so we also learned
          the poem by heart. Then, every time he held our hand, we would read it
          with him. What a parody we have got then! It is the only poem I
          remember until this day.
        </p>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          When we had to study hard for high school graduation and university
          entrance in grade 12, we were one of the few students doing homework
          handed by our school teacher. We still do not understand why we did
          that while other students did homework by their extra course teacher,
          not our school teacher. We laughed about it every time we talked about
          it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">Darkest time</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          We, of course, had conflicts. It happened mostly during university. We
          did not attend the same class with the same people week by week like
          in high school because we studied different majors at different
          universities. Different majors and universities come with different
          perspectives. The distance cracks the relationship as well. I believe
          when there are not many conversations, it is hard to get close to the
          people you know. However, one thing I learned from that time is that
          when people have built a pure friendship, they will find a way to
          resolve any conflicts and distances. So did we.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">My bro’s marriage</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          That guy told me that he had a girlfriend a year ago. They had been
          friends for a year and a half before. He and I scheduled many times so
          that he could introduce his girlfriend to me in person but we failed
          due to many reasons (rain, sickness, etc.). Fast forward to this Lunar
          New Year, he surprised me that he would marry his girlfriend, which
          caused me a night without good sleep. He would be her husband.
          Finally, I had a chance to meet his fiancée after Lunar New Year’s Eve
          at his house. After a few talks did I realize that she was the woman
          to whom he had to get married.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Before the wedding photobook shooting session, I asked them to become
          their deputy film photographer. They accepted. However, life cannot be
          more cruel to me. I broke my camera and got COVID-19 one week before
          the shooting day. Fortunately, she lent me her film camera but hers
          was a viewfinder while mine was a rangefinder. I recovered from
          COVID-19 just two days before as well.
        </p>

          class="post__image"
        />
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          During the session, I was extremely nervous because I did not get used
          to her camera. Nevertheless, somehow they trusted me with all their
          guts. I managed to shoot with all the knowledge I had of the
          viewfinder. In the end, their trust paid off. Although half of the
          roll was a waste, the others were a masterpiece. At first, I set the
          shutter speed too low causing the photos blurry and overexposed.
          Later, I doubled the shutter speed using my gut feeling and got the
          perfect results.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          On their wedding day, this time I bought a new camera with an
          automatic light meter. The light meter does save me a lot of money on
          film. It frees me from wasting time light-metering the environment to
          focus entirely on the upcoming moment. Thus, their film wedding photos
          were exceptional. 36 exposures results in 36 beautiful lively
          pictures. I have saved their memory. It was pure, lovely, and
          imperfect. They hired professional photography videography staff to
          capture and record their perfect moments with a telelens and a gimbal.
          I myself embraced the imperfection for them with handheld recording
          and some shaky film photos.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I hope that I help them fulfill their love desire. After all, we are
          close friends. We do not seek perfection. We seek purity, love, and
          humanity in our brotherhood. I believe that it matters the most.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post__heading_1">The Future</h2>
        <p class="post__paragraph">
          I look forward to the future they build together. I know that they
          always have my back in case they need my help.
