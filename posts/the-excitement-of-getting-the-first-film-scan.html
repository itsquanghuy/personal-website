          I love film photography. The grain and the film color make me
          goosebumps. I have been taking many film photos since 2021 after my
          colleague introduced me to his camera. Every time I bring my roll to
          the lab, go home, and wait for the result, the same feeling grows in
          my body as the day to receive the scan is close. I am always nervous
          yet excited to see my accomplishment. However, the nervousness and the
          excitement were even bigger the first time I looked forward to getting
          my first one. The reason for an explanation is simple. It was a mess.

          At first, my colleague taught me some fundamental knowledge about
          photography such as ISO, shutter speed, and aperture. I must say I did
          not understand anything. Hence, he suggested me to download a light
          meter app on my phone. Life was much easier. Then, I brought his
          camera to the resting room and set the camera up with the settings the
          app metered for me. I started shooting. The photos were great at this
          point. I was happy.

          My happiness stayed not for too long, I kicked off messing up. Life
          was not easy at all, especially for an adventurous person like me.
          After taking quality photos using the meter app, I wanted to be more
          professional. I dropped off my phone. I let my instinct tell me what
          settings need changing. However, my instinct was terrible. Even
          nowadays, my instinct is quite bad as well. When sending an email with
          an attached scan, the lab told me that some were too overexposed or
          underexposed that they cannot see the result. The photo above was the
          least underexposed that they could return to me.

          Another mistake I made was to open the film camera’s back. I opened it
          many times until another colleague warned me not to do it because it
          would expose the film to the light and ruin everything. Fortunately,
          only a few photos were “too overexposed” and I could still see the
          others with special exposing effects.

          In general, it was not a big failure. I still had some great photos to
          post on my Instagram. I had a chance to fall in love with this amazing
          kind of photography because I am an indie man and I love vintage
          stuff.
