          I love capturing moments. I believe that the more years to come, the
          more valuable a photo will be. However, when I look back my previous
          photos from 2017, most of them taken by my phone do not contain any
          value at all. There is no riddle needing an answer. Meanwhile, I have
          started taking film photos since 2021. Excluding some failed shots,
          most of my successful film photos stay and give the readers some
          meanings from them. Those clues make make me think about why I
          captured many bad invaluable photos back then and how I could get the
          most valuable stories out of my photos.

        <p class="post__paragraph">
          Suddenly, I realize that I take photos too fast using my phone or my
          digital camera. I do not let my eye see, my mind think and my heart
          beat before clicking. When my heart does not beat, how do I expect my
          readers to feel what my heart wants to tell them if it does not say
          anything at all? Therefore, I decided to put my Moment phone lens in
          my closet, return my digital camera back to my father and buy a new
          film camera with an automatic light meter. I archived all my photos on
          Instagram which are not film as well. I force myself to really see and
          feel the surrounding before I put my camera on, adjust the focus and
          click. It actually worked. Together with the vintage film color, my
          recent photos look deeper and more meaningful, which gives the readers
          a riddle needing an answer. Above all, I do slow myself down and have
          an opportunity to think of what is worth being in my photos.
