        <p>
          From childhood to the present day, I have always been passionate about
          creating something meaningful, just as Apple CEO Tim Cook talks about
          enriching people's lives. Over the years, my career aspirations have
          evolved, but my mindset of building valuable products has remained
          constant. I believe I've found a career path that allows me to channel
          this passion into making a positive impact on society.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my early years, I dreamt of being like Superman, a symbol of
          humanity's values. In my teenage years, my fascination shifted to
          cars, and I aspired to become a mechanic, creating beautiful vehicles
          that people would love. As I matured, technology, especially Apple
          products, captured my interest, leading me to pursue a career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from my professional journey, I also enjoy hobbies like music
          and football. Music has been a cherished passion in my life, where I
          play by feeling rather than sheet music, infusing emotion into every
          note. Additionally, football has been a longstanding interest, with a
          preference for a defensive role to architect our team's strategy,
          emphasizing teamwork over individual glory, a sentiment that extends
          even to football video games where I relish managerial modes that
          emphasize collective play.
        </p>
        <p>
          My desire to contribute to humanity has been a common thread
          throughout my life, fostering a product-oriented mindset that
          originated in my childhood. However, I didn't fully grasp the
          significance of this mindset until I became a Software Engineer. In
          this role, I honed my skills in clean coding, technology stacks, and
          delved deep into programming languages' core libraries. This
          experience instilled discipline and organization in me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my growth as a Software Engineer, I realized that my
          personality was better suited for roles that allowed me to contribute
          to the business aspects of a product. I wanted to understand how my
          work influenced the product's success. So, I transitioned to the role
          of a Business Analyst, immersing myself in a new world of business
          knowledge and expanding my skills in UX design, making me feel
          valuable to both the business and society.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several years in roles as a Software Engineer and Business
          Analyst, and after completing my degree, I took a much-needed break to
          reevaluate my career path. During this time, I embarked on a tourism
          venture, which taught me valuable lessons in product management and
          development, from ideation to marketing strategy and customer service.
          This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in product
          management, a path I'm determined to follow, no matter the challenges.
          I believe the skills I gained during my venture, combined with my
          existing computer knowledge, will be instrumental in this endeavor.
