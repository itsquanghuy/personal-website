          I have a deep love for film photography. The texture of the grain and
          the unique colors produced by film never fail to give me goosebumps.
          My journey into film photography began in 2021 when a colleague
          introduced me to their camera. Since then, I've been capturing
          countless moments on film. Every time I drop off a roll at the lab,
          head home, and anticipate the results, I experience the same growing
          excitement as the day of scanning approaches. It's a mix of nerves and
          anticipation that never fails to stir within me.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the excitement and nervousness I felt were even more intense
          the first time I eagerly awaited the outcome of my very first film
          roll. The reason behind this heightened emotion is quite simple: it
          was an absolute mess.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, my colleague took the time to impart some fundamental
          photography knowledge to me, covering topics like ISO, shutter speed,
          and aperture. I must admit, at the outset, I didn't grasp much of what
          he was explaining. Consequently, he recommended that I download a
          light meter app on my phone, which made my life significantly easier.
          Armed with this app, I ventured into the resting room with his camera
          and configured it based on the settings the app recommended. That's
          when I began capturing images, and to my delight, the photos turned
          out great at this stage. It brought me immense happiness.

        <p>
          Unfortunately, my initial happiness didn't last long, as I soon began
          to encounter challenges. Life in the realm of film photography wasn't
          easy, particularly for someone as adventurous as myself. After
          successfully taking quality photos with the help of the meter app, I
          started yearning to become more proficient and decided to set aside
          the app. I relied on my instincts to guide me on adjusting the camera
          settings, but it turned out my instincts were far from reliable. Even
          to this day, my instincts in this regard are often quite poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recall one incident when I sent some film rolls to the lab for
          development, and they informed me that certain photos were either
          severely overexposed or underexposed, making it impossible for them to
          produce clear results. The photo you see above was among the least
          underexposed ones that they were able to return to me. It was a
          frustrating setback in my photographic journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made yet another mistake when I repeatedly opened the back of the
          film camera. It became a habit until another colleague cautioned me
          against doing it, explaining that opening the camera back would expose
          the film to light and potentially ruin the entire roll. Thankfully,
          the damage was limited, and only a few photos were "too overexposed"
          as a result. Surprisingly, the other photos developed some unique and
          unexpected exposing effects, which, in a way, added a distinctive
          charm to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          All in all, it wasn't a major failure. I still managed to capture some
          fantastic photos that I could proudly share on my Instagram. This
          experience allowed me to develop a deep appreciation for this
          incredible form of photography, which perfectly resonates with my
          indie spirit and my love for all things vintage.
