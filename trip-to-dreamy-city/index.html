        <blockquote>

        <p>
          Many people find it easy to hop from one city to another without much
          hesitation. However, for me, a myriad of seemingly trivial reasons
          (such as it being too cold, too far away, or too rainy) had kept me
          from visiting Da Lat city for my entire life. But finally, I had the
          chance to experience it, and it's difficult to encapsulate the wonder
          of this city in just a single word.
        </p>
        <p>
          From its people to its natural beauty, Da Lat is truly exceptional.
          Here, despite falling ill on the first day due to the temperature
          difference, I ultimately discovered the inner peace I had been seeking
          for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can a relatively small, chilly city have such a profound impact on
          a person's well-being? Let's delve into it and explore!
        </p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>
          Delicate, simple, and energetic – these words perfectly encapsulate
          the essence of the local vibes in Da Lat.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/2.webp" alt="Portrait of Mrs. Xuan Nam" />
        <p>
          The lady featured in the photo is Mrs. Xuan Nam, who runs a small
          kitchen where she personally prepares and serves food. Her kitchen
          operates exclusively by reservation, and I had the privilege of
          reserving a spot there on two occasions. Why did I make these
          reservations? It's because I have a genuine fondness for engaging in
          conversations with local residents who possess intimate knowledge of
          their city and its daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets her kitchen apart is the special touch it offers: her
          husband, Mr. Duc, is a skilled and accomplished pianist. As she cooks,
          he serenades with beautiful piano melodies. The combination of their
          talents creates a truly delightful and unique dining experience.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/3.webp" alt="He is playing piano" />
        <p>
          I dedicated an entire hour to engaging in a conversation solely about
          music with Mr. Duc, particularly delving into the history and sharing
          tips and tricks related to music. Interestingly, despite having
          studied engineering, his passion for the piano runs deep, and it
          serves as a means to balance his life. Furthermore, he holds a special
          affection for the compositions of Chopin. I distinctly recall the
          sparkle in his eyes as he passionately discussed the nuances and
          distinctions between Chopin's and Beethoven's music. Our conversation
          came to a close when his wife called me over to enjoy the meal she had
          lovingly prepared.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/4.webp" alt="She is cooking" />
        <p>
          Before I reveal the meal, I'd like to shed light on Mrs. Nam's cooking
          and serving approach. Following the confirmation of my reservation,
          she would make a trip to the local market to source fresh beef, fresh
          fruits, and fresh vegetables. This commitment to freshness not only
          imparts an organic quality to the meal but also ensures it's a healthy
          choice, particularly important during a trip when dining out is the
          norm.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/5.webp" alt="She invites other to join her" />
        <p>
          While preparing the meal, Mrs. Nam would often invite me and others to
          join her in the kitchen. Participating in the meal preparation was a
          unique and enriching experience. It felt like she was not only
          creating a delicious meal but also fostering a sense of togetherness
          and shared moments. Her warm approach conveyed a sense of striving to
          enhance the quality of life for everyone who had the pleasure of
          dining at her kitchen.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/6.webp" alt="The meal" />
        <p>
          While enjoying my meal, I had the opportunity to engage in
          conversations with the other individuals seated around the table.
          Among them, one person left a lasting impression on me: a woman born
          in rural Hanoi but residing in Da Lat for over a decade. She shared
          insights about her career, life experiences, and her perspective on
          various matters. In addition, she inquired about my tourism business
          and generously connected me with her friends working in the tourism
          industry in Da Lat. Her willingness to assist and offer
          recommendations was truly gracious and appreciated.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/7.webp" alt="The kitchen vibe" />
        <p>
          Following our pleasant meal and conversation, Mrs. Nam, the lady from
          Hanoi, and I exchanged phone numbers, paving the way for future
          meet-ups and recommendations. We captured some photographs to
          commemorate the occasion, bid our farewells with warm regards, and I
          resumed my journey in Da Lat, carrying with me the cherished memories
          of our encounter.
        </p>
        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>
          The nature in Da Lat is indeed quite complex. It has the capacity to
          be peaceful and tranquil, yet also exhibit a more aggressive and
          dynamic side, often all at the same time.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/8.webp" alt="Tuyen Lam Lake" />
        <p>
          This is Tuyen Lam Lake. On a rainy day, it exuded a serene and
          tranquil beauty. I parked my scooter near the lake, and despite the
          rain, I ventured out, using any available means to shield my camera
          from getting wet, and I began capturing the scene. The breathtaking
          scenery left me with a longing for lower film prices, as I wished I
          could purchase more film rolls to capture even more of the mesmerizing
          views.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/9.webp" alt="Datanla Waterfall" />
        <p>
          Continuing on my journey, I made my way to Datanla Waterfall. The
          waterfall was remarkably powerful, with droplets that could have
          potentially damaged my camera if I had ventured too close. As a
          precaution, I stepped back to a safe distance, ensuring that no
          droplets could reach my camera. From this vantage point, I captured a
          shot that became a cherished addition to my collection of memories
          from the trip.
        </p>
        <h2>Cafés</h2>
        <p>
          During my visit to Da Lat, I had the pleasure of exploring three
          renowned vintage cafés in the city. However, I decided to capture
          photographs at only two of them, as I wanted to conserve my film for
          future opportunities and experiences.
        </p>
        <h3>Duong</h3>
        <p>
          Upon arriving at
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XrMim5v7m3Qfc3mi8?g_st=ic"
            >this café</a
          >, my initial impression was one of warmth and comfort. It exuded a
          cozy atmosphere, with a large bookshelf occupying the garret, adding
          to its inviting ambiance.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/10.webp" alt="Duong Cafe" />
        <p>
          I opted for a seasonal ice cream, which was tailored to the flavors of
          the current season. During that time, plums were in season, so they
          prepared a delightful plum ice cream for me. While seated in the
          garret, relishing my ice cream, I took the opportunity to conduct some
          research on how to transform my photography-focused Instagram into a
          platform for more profound and insightful content. It was in this very
          café that I made the momentous decision to start writing blogs about
          photography and life, marking a significant shift in my creative
          journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Tung</h3>
        <p>
          I discovered
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qTPHoUx9mgsTATz49?g_st=ic"
            >this vintage café</a
          >
          through the movie "Em và Trinh," which tells the life story of the
          musician known as the "Vietnamese Bob Dylan," Trinh Cong Son. His
          songs are deeply cherished by the Vietnamese people for their
          romantic, profound, and at times, melancholic themes.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/11.webp" alt="Tung Cafe" />
        <p>
          Following my viewing of the movie, I delved deeper into the history of
          the café and was truly fascinated to learn that it was established
          around 1940. Over the years, it had become a gathering place for
          artists, where the unique ambiance inspired them to reach their peak
          of creativity.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/12.webp" alt="Tung Cafe" />
        <p>
          Stepping into the café, I could sense an atmosphere that was
          undoubtedly conducive to artistic inspiration. I decided to order an
          original yogurt, a specialty that can be quite challenging to
          find—especially one that is handmade. In Da Lat, it's commonly
          referred to as "Yao gua," although the name for this yogurt can vary
          significantly from place to place in Vietnam. In Hanoi, for instance,
          we use a completely different Vietnamese name for it.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/13.webp" alt="Tung Cafe" />
        <p>
          As I savored my "Yao gua," the café played some timeless Andy Williams
          songs, including classics like "Love Story" and "Speak Softly, Love."
          These good old songs, with their simplicity and elegance, added to the
          overall charm of the experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Restaurants</h2>
        <p>
          During my time in Da Lat, I dined at numerous restaurants, each
          offering its own unique culinary experience. However, I only managed
          to capture photographs at one of them due to the common constraint of
          limited film availability. The scarcity of film can indeed pose a
          challenge when you want to document every memorable dining experience.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/14.webp" alt="Banh Canh" />
        <p>
          I sampled
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/r1pMSAtxm4mywZTt5?g_st=ic"
            >Banh Canh</a
          >, a dish consisting of noodles with fish sausage, fried onions, and
          fresh vegetables. Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet my taste
          preferences, as it was both too spicy and not very tasty.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to the other restaurants, some served dishes with
          excessive protein (heavy on the meat), while others were overly fatty.
          As a result, none of these dining experiences left a lasting
          impression on me, with the exception of Mrs. Nam's kitchen, which
          stood out for its unique and memorable offerings.
        </p>
        <h2>Local Market</h2>
        <p>
          The market in Da Lat is undeniably intriguing. It consistently draws
          large crowds, particularly at night, which often leads to traffic
          congestion in the vicinity. During my visit, I chose not to make any
          purchases. Instead, I simply wandered around, taking in the market
          from my own perspective and savoring the vibrant atmosphere it
          offered.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/15.webp" alt="Dalat Market" />
        <p>
          I came across a renowned location known as the "Hong Kong spot," a
          favorite among teenagers and young people for taking selfies, as the
          backdrop resembles Hong Kong in the 1990s. Finding my way to this spot
          proved to be quite a challenge, involving numerous staircases and
          occasional moments of getting stuck and having to retrace my steps.
          However, after persevering, I finally reached the spot, and it was
          certainly worth the effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lacking models for my photos, I decided to change my perspective.
          Instead of capturing images straight ahead, I angled my camera
          downward, focusing on the lively street below. It was bustling with
          activity, and I seized the opportunity to capture the vibrant
          atmosphere.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/16.webp" alt="Dalat Market" />
        <p>
          I proceeded to take photos of the people around me, drawing
          inspiration from Joel Meyerowitz's style. The subjects varied—some
          individuals simply walked by, some paused to take a photograph, and
          others not only stopped but engaged in conversation with each other.
          It was a diverse and dynamic mix of people, each contributing to the
          unique atmosphere of the moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I developed a deep affection for Da Lat. Its cold yet
          comfortable weather, warm and lovely people, and breathtaking scenery
          left a lasting impression on me. I can confidently say that I will
          return to Da Lat one day to relive these beautiful memories, which
          have had a positive impact on my overall well-being. Until next time,
          Da Lat!
