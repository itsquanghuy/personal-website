          I have a deep love for capturing moments, and I firmly believe that as
          the years pass, photos become increasingly valuable. However, when I
          look back at my previous photos from 2017, most of them taken with my
          phone seem to lack any real value. There's no mystery to unravel or
          story to tell in those images. In contrast, since I started taking
          film photos in 2021, excluding some failed shots, the majority of my
          successful film photos have enduring significance, offering viewers
          meaningful insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          This realization prompted me to reflect on why I had taken so many
          poor and insignificant photos in the past and how I could extract the
          most valuable stories from my images. It dawned on me that I had been
          taking photos too hastily with my phone or digital camera. I hadn't
          allowed my eyes to truly see, my mind to contemplate, or my heart to
          connect with the moment before pressing the shutter button. If my
          heart didn't beat with emotion during those moments, how could I
          expect my viewers to feel what I wanted to convey when there was
          nothing to express?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, I made a decision. I placed my Moment phone lens in the
          closet, returned my digital camera to my father, and invested in a new
          film camera equipped with an automatic light meter. I also archived
          all my non-film photos on Instagram. I resolved to force myself to
          slow down, to genuinely observe and feel my surroundings before
          framing a shot, adjusting the focus, and capturing the image. And it
          worked. Combined with the vintage film colors, my recent photos now
          possess greater depth and meaning, inviting viewers to ponder the
          riddles they present. Most importantly, I've learned to pace myself,
          to consider what truly deserves a place in my photos.
