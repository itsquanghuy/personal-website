          Work and rest go hand in hand, and I firmly believe that maintaining a
          balance between the two is essential. Opting to visit Vung Tau City
          turned out to be a wise decision, providing me with the much-needed
          respite from my work. Vung Tau isn't a flashy city with towering
          skyscrapers or a wide array of renowned traditional dishes. Instead,
          its claim to fame lies in its tranquil and unhurried ambiance, which
          draws people in. It's a place where the sea, the mountains, and the
          people collectively create an environment that encourages you to savor
          each and every moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't focus on capturing food photos during my visit because Vung
          Tau isn't particularly celebrated for its cuisine, as you mentioned.
          Instead, I turned my lens toward the people and the picturesque
          scenery, preserving the essence of this city through my photography.
        </p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>
          Upon my arrival at my aunt's house, an amusing incident unfolded. My
          nephew, in an enthusiastic manner, rushed toward me and embraced me
          tightly. It wasn't until later that we realized she had mistaken me
          for my aunt's son, who happens to bear a striking resemblance to me.
          This mix-up resulted in the heartfelt hug, which led to a bout of
          laughter shared among us. Despite the initial confusion, my affection
          for my nephew remained as strong as ever, and we all had a good laugh
          about the incident.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/2.webp" alt="My nephew" />
        <p>
          In addition to the mix-up, my niece and I shared a close bond. She
          developed a fascination for my analog camera, the Canon Canonet G-III
          QL17. She was genuinely curious about why she couldn't view the photos
          immediately after they were taken. I tried my best to explain the
          unique nature of a film camera, but it proved challenging for her to
          grasp. It was a clear instance where the generation gap became evident
          in our real-life interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, I seized the opportunity to capture some beautiful
          moments with her using a Fuji C200 film roll, which produced stunning
          and vibrant colors. I must say the film roll didn't disappoint me at
          all. In the frames, my niece appeared radiant, playful, and absolutely
          lovely. These photos became precious keepsakes of our time together.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/3.webp" alt="People playing Chinese chess" />
        <p>
          As I ventured outside, I came across a park where people were either
          exercising or engaged in games of Chinese chess. Intrigued by the
          scene, I paused, reached for my camera, and began taking photographs.
          This outing marked the first time I used my new camera, and as a
          result, only one of the photos I took turned out well.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this particular shot, two men were locked in a tense match of
          Chinese chess. At one point, one of the men noticed my presence and
          gestured for me to move away, signaling for me to leave. Fortunately,
          I managed to capture the moment at precisely the right instant,
          ensuring that no trace of his irritated gesture was visible in the
          photo. It became a compelling image, freezing that intense moment in
          time without any hint of annoyance or frustration.
        </p>
        <h2>Sightseeing</h2>
        <p>
          Upon my arrival in Vung Tau, my aunt kindly introduced me to a local
          young man who would serve as my "tour guide" during my first day
          there. He happened to be two years younger than me, and from the
          outset, it was clear that he was a kind and humble individual. After
          my photo excursion in the park, I returned home and eagerly awaited
          the arrival of my local guide.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/4.webp" alt="Somewhere on the hill" />
        <p>
          When he arrived at my aunt's house, we exchanged introductions. Since
          it was late in the afternoon, he drove me to a nearby coast where I
          had hoped to capture some stunning sunset photos. Regrettably, there
          was no sunset to be seen that evening. Nevertheless, the scenery was
          so breathtaking that I was able to capture some beautiful moments
          despite the absence of the sun's descent below the horizon.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/5.webp" alt="Lovers on the hill" />
        <p>
          This shot is a perfect example of the beautiful moments I captured
          during that time. As I adjusted my camera downward, I noticed a lovely
          couple seated near the wave-cut cliff, engrossed in a conversation
          with each other. Naturally, I couldn't resist capturing the scene. It
          was a remarkable blend of intimacy within the vast expanse of the
          surroundings – a truly special moment to witness and preserve.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/6.webp" alt="Scooter near the beach" />
        <p>
          As we made our way down to the berm, we encountered a scooter parked
          by the shore, its owner having left it behind while they went fishing.
          The sight of the solitary scooter, set against the backdrop of the
          cloudy sky and captured on the Fuji C200 film roll, truly conveyed a
          sense of loneliness in the photo. It's a poignant image that
          encapsulates the deserted atmosphere of the moment.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/7.webp" alt="Before sunrise on the beach" />
        <p>
          The following morning, I borrowed my aunt's motorcycle and made my way
          back to the coast that my "tour guide" and I had previously visited in
          hopes of capturing the sunrise. This time, luck was on my side as the
          sky was clear, devoid of clouds. As the sun began its ascent, its
          light grew stronger and stronger. Despite the harsh lighting
          conditions, I couldn't resist continuously taking photographs of the
          breathtaking sunrise unfolding before me.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/8.webp" alt="People watching sunrise" />
        <p>
          Street photography indeed has its own charm because it doesn't require
          a model to create a compelling photo. You simply observe your
          surroundings, and when you come across a moment where a person fits
          perfectly into your frame, you click the shutter. It's a valuable
          lesson that I've internalized and taken to heart in my photography
          journey. It teaches you to find beauty and meaning in the everyday
          scenes and people around you.
        </p>
        <h2>Final words</h2>
        <p>
          It's uncertain when I'll have the opportunity to visit Vung Tau once
          more, but I'm certain that it holds a special place in my memory. The
          city provided me with a wonderful retreat, thanks to its unique
          atmosphere. So, I say to Vung Tau, "One day, I'll return!"
