            Throughout a human life, 12 years is a relatively big number for not
            only a friendship but also brotherhood. These two classmates’
            relationship duration is not an exception.

            The Excitement Of Getting The First Film Scan

            I love film photography. The grain and the film color make me
            goosebumps. I have been taking many film photos since 2021 after my
            colleague introduced me to his camera. Every time I bring my roll to
            the lab, go home, and wait for the result, the same feeling grows in
            my body as the day to receive the scan is close.

            I love capturing moments. I believe that the more years to come, the
            more valuable a photo will be. However, when I look back my previous
            photos from 2017, most of them taken by my phone do not contain any
            value at all. There is no riddle needing an answer. Meanwhile, I
            have started taking film photos since 2021. Excluding some failed
            shots, most of my successful film photos stay and give the readers
            some meanings from them.

            Working comes with resting. I believe the equation always needs
            balancing. Choosing to visit Vung Tau City was a wise choice giving
            me the necessary break from work. Vung Tau is not a fancy city with
            not many tall buildings and not many famous traditional foods. It is
            best known for the slow calm atmosphere to which brings people
            coming. The sea, the mountain, the people. I learned how to feel
            every single moment when living in this city.

            An Unforgettable Trip To A True Dreamy City

            Many people find it easy to travel from one city to another city.
            For me, due to lots of stupid reasons (too cold, too far away, too
            rainy, etc.), I have had to wait my whole life to finally visit Da
            Lat city. From the people to the nature, it is difficult to describe
            how wonderful this city is in only a single word. Here, although I
            had got sick on the first day because of the temperature difference,
            I could eventually find the inner peace that I was always looking
            for for a long time.
